Several springs water the palm groves; “these streams are split into countless channels in stone canals, according to a scrupulously fair system”, wrote Ibn Chabbat in the 13th century. With the passing of centuries, the land became fertile and allowed agricultural cultivation in three levels: vegetable crops and cereals grow in the shade of fruit trees, which themselves are protected by the tall date palms.

Diamonds, chevrons, palms or hexagons, the geometric patterns set a background for your stroll. The small bricks made of clay mixed with sand are characteristic of the architecture of Jerid; they give the towns the ochre colour of the desert. The principal tree of the region, the palm, provides wood for beams and flooring. If you have the chance to visit a beautiful house in Tozeur, you will find there a veritable Saharan palace: around a vast interior courtyard, there is a succession of hallways, archways, bedrooms with high palm ceilings, and chambers with narrow windows where the dates from the last harvest hang.\\n \")])])],1),_c('h3',{attrs:{\"id\":\"know\"}},[_vm._v(\"Good To Know\")]),_vm._m(0),_c('comment'),_vm._m(1)],1)}\nvar staticRenderFns = [function () {var _vm=this;var _h=_vm.$createElement;var _c=_vm._self._c||_h;return _c('div',{attrs:{\"id\":\"info-container\"}},[_c('div',{attrs:{\"id\":\"info\"}},[_c('h2',[_vm._v(\"Festivals\")]),_c('p',[_vm._v(\"Festival of the Oasis: date harvest (in November)\\n\\nElectronic dunes: electronic music on the location of Star Wars\")])]),_c('div',{attrs:{\"id\":\"info\"}},[_c('h2',[_vm._v(\"Transport\")]),_c('p',[_vm._v(\"Tozeur and Nefta are served by an international airport, located 5 minutes from from Tozeur.
