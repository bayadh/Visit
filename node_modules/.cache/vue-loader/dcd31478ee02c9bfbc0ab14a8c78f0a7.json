One of its attractions is the plethora of different monuments and relics from all eras and all religions. You’ll be able to see cisterns and Roman baths, an ancient church dedicated to St Peter, an 18th century Jewish synagogue that is also honoured by the town’s Muslims, and three neighbouring cemeteries: Muslim, Jewish and Christian.

In the Saddine nature reserve near El Kef, you can see some amazing animal species like porcupines and golden eagles. In the old town of El Kef, you can visit the museum of art and popular traditions, housed in a magnificent 18th century religious building; you can find out everything there is to know about equestrian traditions, jewellery from the northwest or life in a Bedouin tent.

Another local dish is malthouth: ground barley prepared in the same way as couscous.

The site of Makthar, one of the largest in Tunisia, is home to some spectacular remains, like the Arch of Trajan, the Large Baths and the elegant colonnade of the School Juvenum. Sbeitla is remarkable due to its Capitol, made up of not one, but three temples dedicated to Minerva, Jupiter and Juno, the gods that protected Rome. In Haïdra, you can see the remains of one of the largest Byzantine fortresses in North Africa, as well as a number of Christian churches. Indeed, the western regions boast extensive traces of ancient Christianity. In Sbeitla, the huge Basilica of Vitalis has a stunning basin for baptisms covered in mosaics. In the countryside, the El Gousset archways are all that remain of a large church, 33 metres long, reminding us that Tunisia was once a key stronghold for Christians in the West.\"\n                )\n              ])\n            ]\n          ),\n          _c(\n            \"b-carousel-slide\",\n            {\n              attrs: {\n                \"img-src\":\n                  \"https://www.discovertunisia.com/en/sites/default/files/jugurtha.jpg\"\n              }\n            },\n            [\n              _c(\"p\", { attrs: { id: \"desc\" } }, [\n                _c(\"b\", [\n                  _c(\"h2\", { attrs: { id: \"title\" } }, [\n                    _vm._v(\"THE JUGURTHA TABLELAND\")\n                  ])\n                ]),\n                _c(\"br\"),\n                _vm._v(\n                  \"\\nJugurtha was a famous ancient Berber prince, a hero of the resistance to the Roman conquest.

Towns, temples and monuments sprang up throughout central Maghreb and the northwest of Tunisia.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Jugurtha Tableland covers 80 hectares and its highest point is at an altitude of 1,271 metres; a real natural fortress that has been used as a refuge throughout history. The Berber prince hid there with his army during his war against the Romans. Completely surrounded by sheer cliffs, it overlooks vast fields of wheat and hills as far as the eye can see. You’ll need to climb up an ancient staircase carved out of the rock to get to the plateau and enjoy a breath-taking 360° view of the surrounding landscape. The site houses a number of different remains, including dolmens, a Byzantine arc, a small mosque, reservoirs carved out of the rock, caves and prehistoric tombs…\"\n                )\n              ])\n            ]\n          )\n        ],\n        1\n      ),\n      _c(\"h3\", { attrs: { id: \"know\" } }, [_vm._v(\"Good To Know\")]),\n      _vm._m(0),\n      _c(\"comment\"),\n      _vm._m(1)\n    ],\n    1\n  )\n}\nvar staticRenderFns = [\n  function() {\n    var _vm = this\n    var _h = _vm.$createElement\n    var _c = _vm._self._c || _h\n    return _c(\"div\", { attrs: { id: \"info-container\" } }, [\n      _c(\"div\", { attrs: { id: \"info\" } }, [\n        _c(\"h2\", [_vm._v(\"Weekly markets\")]),\n        _c(\"p\", [\n          _vm._v(\n            \"Monday: Makthar.
